# Next.js Store Project

**Live Demo:** [Next.js Store](https://nextjs-store-project-one.vercel.app/)

## 📌 Overview
This project is an eCommerce web application built with **Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS**. It was developed as part of my **React & Next.js course**, focusing on key concepts such as dynamic routing, state management, API integration, and authentication.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- **State Management** – Using React hooks (`useState`, `useContext`, `useReducer`).
- **API Integration** – Fetching product data, handling asynchronous operations.
- **Authentication** – Implementing user login & protected routes.
- **Cart Functionality** – Managing cart state and local storage.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS** – Building responsive and modern UI components.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** – Component-based UI structure.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for a sleek design.
- **Context API** – Managing global state without external libraries.
- **Vercel** – Hosting and deployment.
